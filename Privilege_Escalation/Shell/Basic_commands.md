### Netcat commands
```
nc -lvnp <port-number>
```
- **-l** is used to tell netcat that this will be a listener
- **-v** is used to request a verbose output
- **-n** tells netcat not to resolve host names or use DNS. Explaining this is outwith the scope of the room.
- **-p** indicates that the port specification will follow.

_Bind Shells_

If we are looking to obtain a bind shell on a target then we can assume that there is already a listener waiting for us on a chosen port of the target: all we need to do is connect to it. The syntax for this is relatively straight forward:

```
nc <target-ip> <chosen-port>
```
